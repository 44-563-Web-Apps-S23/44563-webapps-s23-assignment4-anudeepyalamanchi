            <p>AUNT CANDACE. Honey, I's been a-waitin' foh you de las' two hours. My
                haid's been bad off. Chile, whah you been? Miss Mawgin must a had a
                pow'ful washin' up at de big house.
                
                     [MARY _opens her hand and shows her a five-dollar bill_.
                
                AUNT CANDACE. De Lawd help my life, chile!
                
                MARY. An' look here what Mr. Henry sent you, too. [_She undoes the
                bundle, revealing several cooked sweet potatoes, sausages, spareribs,
                and some boiled ham._] He said as 'twas Christmas time he sent you this
                with the collards there.
                
                     [_She points toward the collards at the window._ AUNT CANDACE _pays
                     little attention to the food as_ MARY _places it in her lap, but
                     continues to look straight into_ MARY'S _face. The girl starts to
                     give her the money, but she pushes her away._
                
                AUNT CANDACE. [_Excitedly._] Whah'd you git dat, honey? Whah'd you git
                it? Mr. Henry ain't never been dat kind befo'. Dey ain't no past
                Christmas times he was so free wid 'is money. He ain't de kind o' man
                foh dat. An' he a-havin' 'is washin' done on Christmas Eve. [_Her look
                is direct and troubled._] Chile, Mr. Hugh didn't give you dat money, did
                he?
                
                MARY. [_Still looking in the fire._] Aunty, I ain't said Mr. Henry sent
                you this money. Yes'm, Mr. Hugh sent it to you. I done some washin' for
                him. I washed his socks and some shirts--pure silk they was. [_She
                smiles at the remembrance._] An' he give me the money an' tole me to
                give it to you--said he wished he could give you somethin' more.
                
                     [_She hands the money to_ AUNT CANDACE, _who takes it quickly_.
                
                AUNT CANDACE. Help my soul an' body! De boy said dat! Bless 'is soul! He
                ain't fo'got 'is ol' aunty, even if he ain't been to see 'er since he
                come back from school way out yander. De Lawd bless 'im! Allus was a
                good boy, an' he ain't changed since he growed up nuther. When I useter
                nuss 'im he'd never whimper, no suh. Bring me de tin box, honey. An'
                don't notice what I's been sayin'. I spects I's too perticler 'bout you.
                I dunno.
                
                     [MARY _goes to the bureau and gets a tin box. She puts the money
                     in it, returns it, and lights the lamp._ AUNT CANDACE _takes off
                     her bonnet and hangs it behind her on the rocking-chair. Then she
                     begins to eat greedily, now and then licking the grease off her
                     fingers. Suddenly she utters a low scream, putting her hands to her
                     head and rocking to and fro. She grasps her stick and begins
                     beating about her as if striking at something, crying out in a loud
                     voice._
                
                AUNT CANDACE. Ah-hah, I'll git you! I'll git you!
                
                     [MARY _goes to her and pats her on the cheek_.
                
                MARY. It's your poor head, ain't it, aunty? You rest easy, I'll take
                care of you. [_She continues to rub her cheek and forehead until the
                spell passes._] Set still till I git in a turn of light-wood. It's goin'
                to be a terrible cold night an' looks like snow.
                
                     [_After a moment_ AUNT CANDACE _quiets down and begins eating
                     again_. MARY _goes out and brings in an armful of wood which she
                     throws into the box. She takes a bottle and spoon from the mantel,
                     and starts to pour out some medicine._
                
                AUNT CANDACE. I's better now, honey. Put it back up. I ain't gwine take
                none now. D'ain't no use ... d'ain't no use in dat. I ain't long foh dis
                world, ain't long. I's done my las' washin' an' choppin' an' weighed up
                my las' cotton. Medicine ain't no mo' good.
                
                MARY. You're allus talkin' like that, aunty. You're goin' to live to be
                a hundred. An' this medicine----
                
                AUNT CANDACE. I ain't gwine take it, I say. No, suh, ain't gwine be
                long. I's done deef. I's ol' an' hipshot now. No, suh, I don't want no
                medicine. [_Childishly._] I's got a taste o' dese heah spareribs an'
                sausages, an' I ain't gwine take no medicine. [MARY _puts the bottle and
                spoon back on the mantel and sits down_. AUNT CANDACE _stops eating and
                looks at_ MARY'S _dreaming face_.] Honey, what makes you look like dat?
                [_Excitedly._] Mr. Henry ain't said ... he ain't said no mo' 'bout us
                havin' to leave, has he?
                
                MARY. [_Looking up confusedly._] No'm, he ... no'm, he said ... he said
                to-day that he'd 'bout decided to let us stay right on as long as we
                please.
                
                AUNT CANDACE. Huh, what's dat?
                
                MARY. He said it might be so we could stay right on as long as we
                please.
                
                AUNT CANDACE. [_Joyously._] Thank de Lawd! Thank de Lawd! I knowed he's
                gwine do it. I knowed. But I's been pow'ful feared, chile, he's gwine
                run us off. An' he ain't never liked Mr. Hugh's takin' up foh us. But
                now I c'n rest in peace. Thank de Lawd, I's gwine rest my bones rat whah
                I loves to stay till dey calls foh me up yander. [_Stopping._] Has you
                et?
                
                MARY. Yes'm, I et up at Mr. Henry's. Mr. Hugh ... [_hesitating_] he said
                'twas a shame for me to come off without eatin' nothin' an' so I et.</p>
